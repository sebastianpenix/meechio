A place that allows me to collect pictures, stories, personal memories, thoughts, and whatever else I want.  </p>

                <p class="introduction-paragraph">I made the decision to publish this online, because the internet has the ability to cultivate communities of people and provide a space to share thoughts, ideas, and stories. While this platform is mainly about sharing my voice, I would love to hear yours as well.</p>
                <span>-</span>
                <p class="introduction-paragraph">But most importantly, I created meechio to function as a time-capsule. I want a piece of myself (my authentic self) to be established so that in the future, myself and those I love, can look through my past and experience my memories through the creations on this site. </p>
